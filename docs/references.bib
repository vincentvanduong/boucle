	abstract = {Geometric integration is the numerical integration of a differential equation, while preserving one or more of its ‘geometric’ properties exactly, i.e. to within round-off error. Many of these geometric properties are of crucial importance in physical applications: preservation of energy, momentum, angular momentum, phase-space volume, symmetries, time-reversal symmetry, symplectic structure and dissipation are examples. In this paper we present a survey of geometric numerical integration methods for ordinary differential equations. Our aim has been to make the review of use for both the novice and the more experienced practitioner interested in the new developments and directions of the past decade. To this end, the reader who is interested in reading up on detailed technicalities will be provided with numerous signposts to the relevant literature.}

 abstract = {Monte Carlo (MC) is used to draw parameter values from a distribution defined on the structural parameter space of an equation system. Making use of the prior density, the likelihood, and Bayes' Theorem it is possible to estimate posterior moments of both structural and reduced form parameters. The MC method allows a rather liberal choice of prior distributions. The number of elementary operations to be preformed need not be an explosive function of the number of parameters involved. The method overcomes some existing difficulties of applying Bayesian methods to medium size models. The method is applied to a small scale macro model. The prior information used stems from considerations regarding short and long run behavior of the model and form extraneous observations on empirical long term ratios of economic variables. Likelihood contours for several parameter combinations are plotted, and some marginal posterior densities are assessed by MC.},
